        <p>or me, studying at this school is a managerial experience that I can be proud of. Our school located in the central part of the Gulou District. The school’s motto is “Big things done by chewing vegetable roots”. My understanding of this sentence is if we want to succeed, we must start with every little thing, and we must not be afraid of hardships.</p>
<p>Under the influence of school culture and the guidance of teachers, all aspects of students are developing in an all-round way. In learning, we are very attentive and meticulous about our own learning and are able to listen carefully in class and complete homework after class. In addition, the students here are very good at asking questions. Whenever I or my friends encounter problems, we will take the initiative to ask teachers or our classmates. As a result, the schoo always has a good learning atmosphere. </p>
<p>The moral character of the students in this school is also very good. They are kind-hearted and treat everyone with kindness. For example, I often go to feed the stray cats in the school. The students are helpful and know how to share, so everyone has a lot of good friends around. They respect everyone, not only teachers but also staff such as security guards and cleaners on campus. My classmates and I soon became friends with a security uncle because of frequent meetings.</p>
<p>There are also many activities in the school. Every Wednesday, I go to the badminton club to improve my physical fitness. Another example is that when we were a freshman in high school, we studied economics and life in politics, and we formed a small group to try to run a company to make money. </p>
<p>For me, such a learning environment is very beneficial, and I can grow up healthy and happy here. And keep learning new knowledge. I hope that I can change some unhappiness among my classmates through my own efforts, and at the same time continue to carry forward the fine culture of our school and let him improve more people</p>
